## ðŸ‘‹ About ðŸ‘‹
My name is Parker. I'm a software engineer professionally and avid tech enthusiast personally. I enjoy learning new skills and working on personal projects to further develop those skills. I particularly enjoy developing projects that relate to my love for tabletop roleplaying games like Dungeons and Dragons and other avenues of creative and immersive storytelling.
